# Bike Rental Demand Forecasting with Azure Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to leverage Azure Machine Learning’s Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) capabilities to predict daily bike rental demand. By exploring a dataset of historical rentals, weather conditions, and seasonal attributes, we build and deploy a regression model that can estimate the expected number of rentals for a given day.

## Core Concepts

- **Azure Machine Learning Workspace:** A cloud-based hub to manage datasets, experiments, trained models, and deployment endpoints in a unified environment.
  
- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML):** A tool within Azure ML that automatically selects the best algorithm, tunes hyperparameters, and performs feature engineering, reducing the need for manual model experimentation and speeding up the solution development process.

- **Regression Task:** Since we aim to predict a continuous numerical value (the expected rental count), this is a regression problem. The model takes input features (e.g., date, season, weather conditions) and outputs a single numeric prediction (number of bike rentals).

- **Real-Time Deployment:** After model training and selection, the chosen model is deployed as a real-time endpoint. This makes the model accessible via a standard web service, allowing external applications to easily request predictions on new data.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Registration and Preparation:**  
   Historical bike rental data, including seasonal and meteorological variables, is registered and stored in Azure ML. This ensures consistent, versioned access to datasets for future experiments.

2. **Model Development with AutoML:**  
   AutoML explores a variety of algorithms and preprocessing techniques. It automatically selects the most promising model configuration based on a performance metric (such as normalized RMSE), reducing the guesswork and time normally required in model selection.

3. **Evaluation and Selection:**  
   The best-performing model is identified through data-driven comparisons. Metrics such as error distributions and predicted vs. actual plots help validate the model’s accuracy and reliability.

4. **Deployment as an Endpoint:**  
   Once the top model is confirmed, it is deployed as a secure, scalable endpoint. This endpoint can handle incoming requests in real time and return predictions, enabling seamless integration into dashboards, websites, or other decision-support systems.

5. **Testing and Integration:**  
   With the endpoint available, testing the model becomes straightforward. Sending a JSON payload with relevant input features returns a prediction, which can then be integrated into operational tools for demand forecasting and strategic planning.

## Advantages of This Approach

- **Reduced Development Time:** AutoML automates trial-and-error in model building, allowing data scientists and engineers to focus on interpretation and value extraction instead of low-level configuration.
- **Scalability and Maintenance:** Hosted entirely in the cloud, the solution is easy to scale and maintain. Computing resources and deployment configurations can be adjusted to meet performance demands.
- **Continuous Improvement:** As new data arrives or conditions change, the model can be quickly retrained or updated, ensuring the predictions remain accurate over time.

## Next Steps

- **Refinement:** Explore manual hyperparameter tuning or incorporate advanced feature engineering to further improve model accuracy.
- **Integration:** Link the endpoint to production systems, such as supply chain tools or city planning dashboards, to support data-driven decision-making.
- **Monitoring:** Implement model performance monitoring to detect data drift or reduced accuracy, triggering periodic retraining or model updates as needed.
